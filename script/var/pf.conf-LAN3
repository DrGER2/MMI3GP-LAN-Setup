# scrub
scrub in all no-df

# outgoing connections on MOST must not exceed 968 segmentsize (MTU 1008 total)
scrub out on mam0 max-mss 968

# Skip all PF filtering on lo0
set skip on lo0

### NAT/redirection rules 
### table name has to be used in SW to alter table
table <natRangeTable> { 192.168.1.0/24, 10.0.0.101 }
nat on en5 from <natRangeTable> to any -> (en5)

### DNS Redirect rules ?
rdr on mam0 inet proto udp from (mam0:network) to 10.0.2.100 port domain -> 192.168.0.1
rdr on uap0 inet proto udp from (uap0:network) to 192.168.1.100 port domain -> 192.168.0.1

### filter rules

# pass through DHCP from WLAN to DHCP server
pass in quick on uap0 proto udp from any port bootpc to $broadcast_add port bootps keep state

# let our http server on 8100 for UPnP be reachable
